# Code the Classics: Rust port

Rust port of [Code the Classics](https://wireframe.raspberrypi.org/books/code-the-classics1), using the [ggez](https://ggez.rs) engine.

## Games

The project is composed of the clones of five classic games:

- Pong
- Bubble Bobble
- Frogger
- Centipede
- Sensible Soccer

## Original project

The original project is written in Python, with PyGame Zero. A beautiful [book](https://wireframe.raspberrypi.org/books/code-the-classics1) has been published, which can also be downloaded for free; of course, readers are strongly encouraged to buy a copy, which is very cheap (8Â£).
