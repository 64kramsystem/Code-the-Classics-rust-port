# Rust Game Ports

My ports of open source games to Rust, using different pure-Rust game engines.

The current completed ports are:

- Code the Classics Vol. 1/Boing: ported to [ggez](https://github.com/ggez/ggez)
- Code the Classics Vol. 1/Cavern: ported to [Macroquad](https://github.com/not-fl3/macroquad) (without using experimental features)

My current plans are to port:

- [Rusty Roguelike](https://github.com/thebracket/HandsOnRust) to [Bevy](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy)
- Other Code the Classics Vol. 1 games to [Fyrox](https://github.com/FyroxEngine/Fyrox)

## Source Projects

- Code the Classics Vol. 1 ([repository](https://github.com/Wireframe-Magazine/Code-the-Classics) and [book](https://wireframe.raspberrypi.org/books/code-the-classics1)): A very beautiful book on beginning game programming, written in Python; the project comprises of several games of different genres, each with a surprising complexity under the hood
