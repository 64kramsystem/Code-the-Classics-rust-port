# Code the Classics: Rust port

Rust ports of [Code the Classics](https://wireframe.raspberrypi.org/books/code-the-classics1), using different engines and approaches.

The current completed ports are:

- Boing: [ggez](https://github.com/ggez/ggez)
- Cavern: [Macroquad](https://github.com/not-fl3/macroquad) (without experimental crates)

Currently, a [Tetra](https://github.com/17cupsofcoffee/Tetra) port is in progress, with [Legion](https://github.com/amethyst/legion) as storage. Subsequently (and separately), it will be integrated with [Tiled](https://github.com/mapeditor/tiled) or [LDtk](https://github.com/deepnight/ldtk).

The next scheduled ports are [Bevy](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy), and potentially, [RG3D](https://github.com/rg3dengine/rg3d).

## Games

The project is composed of the clones of five classic games:

- Pong ("Boing")
- Bubble Bobble ("Cavern")
- Frogger ("Bunner")
- Centipede ("Myriapod")
- Sensible Soccer ("Soccer")

## Original project

The original project is written in Python, with PyGame Zero. A beautiful [book](https://wireframe.raspberrypi.org/books/code-the-classics1) has been published, which can also be downloaded for free; of course, readers are strongly encouraged to buy a copy, which is very cheap (8Â£).
