## Ports

### Boing/ggez

A very straightforward port ðŸ™‚

This port suffers from one bug:

- corruption when running on fullscreen (reported [here](https://github.com/ggez/ggez/issues/1066)).

### Cavern/Macroquad

Another very straightforward port ðŸ™‚

This port suffers from two Macroquad bugs:

- the music starts with a delay (reported by another developer [here](https://github.com/not-fl3/macroquad/issues/440));
- on Nvidia cards, on Linux, CPU runs at 100% load (reported [here](https://github.com/not-fl3/macroquad/issues/275#issuecomment-939525290)).

Only the stable part of the library is used (the experimental [`scene`](https://github.com/not-fl3/macroquad/blob/master/src/experimental/scene.rs) API is not used).

### Rusty Roguelike/Bevy ECS

The ECS part of this game, originally Legion, has been ported to Bevy (the graphic/input library used is still [bracket-lib](https://github.com/amethyst/bracket-lib)).

I wrote a mini book, ["Learn Bevy's ECS by ripping off someone else's project"](https://saveriomiroddi.github.io/learn_bevy_ecs_by_ripping_off), based on this project.

### Soccer/Fyrox

This port required a non-trivial restructuring, in order to move to a scene-graph based design.

The port suffers from two Fyrox bugs:

- at least one sound plays with a delay (reported [here](https://github.com/FyroxEngine/Fyrox/issues/324));
- some images render incorrectly (reported [here](https://github.com/FyroxEngine/Fyrox/issues/320)).
