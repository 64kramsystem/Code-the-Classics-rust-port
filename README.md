# Code the Classics: Rust port

Rust ports of [Code the Classics](https://wireframe.raspberrypi.org/books/code-the-classics1), using different engines and approaches.

The current completed ports are:

- Boing: ggez
- Cavern: Macroquad (naive port)

Other ports will be slowly added. There may be a Bevy port of Boing, but generally, Macroquad will be used (with idiomatically written ports).

## Games

The project is composed of the clones of five classic games:

- Pong ("Boing")
- Bubble Bobble ("Cavern")
- Frogger ("Bunner")
- Centipede ("Myriapod")
- Sensible Soccer ("Soccer")

## Original project

The original project is written in Python, with PyGame Zero. A beautiful [book](https://wireframe.raspberrypi.org/books/code-the-classics1) has been published, which can also be downloaded for free; of course, readers are strongly encouraged to buy a copy, which is very cheap (8Â£).
